# ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

**Objective:**
Analyze transactional retail data to uncover profit-draining categories, optimize inventory turnover, and identify seasonal product behavior.

**Dataset Used:**
- Rossmann Store Sales Dataset (Kaggle)

**Tools & Technologies:**
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn)

**Major Steps:**
- Cleaned and processed sales and store metadata using SQL views
- Merged datasets to create a full store-sales analytical model
- Calculated profit margins, promo sales percentage, and turnover proxies
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs, profit trends, and seasonality

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Excel

**Major Steps:**
- Cleaned transaction data and engineered Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features
- Built a regression model (XGBoost Regressor) to predict customer LTV
- Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE metrics
- Created professional visualizations (distribution plots, feature correlations, Pareto charts)
- Exported final LTV predictions to CSV for business use

**Deliverables:**
- Python Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Customer LTV Prediction CSV (.csv)
- Final Project Report (PDF)

**Folder:** `/Project2_Customer_Lifetime_Value/`
